# rpytracker
Python scripts that helped in the creation of a GPS tracker using a raspberry pi 3 model b and a GPS module. The scripts send data over to a Firebase Cloud Firestore database.

gps-tracker.py is the current version, other files show the progression of the script.

The gps-tracker.py file is used by the raspberry pi to parse data from a gps module using the NMEA standard to a cloud firestore database in firebase.
